Case Study 3D-printed Truck
---------------------------

*Overview*. The real-world *3D-printed truck* product line is produced
in an academic production system, the *Testbed for Industry 4.0 (I4.0)*
at [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://ciirc.cvut.cz/teams-labs/testbed/). The I4.0 Testbed is used
for research and technology transfer on various topics of and
collaborative robot-human production, like process scheduling and
optimization and adaptive production. The I4.0 Testbed can manipulate
different products using three robot arms and a conveyor belt that can
be flexibly configured. The truck case is of low complexity with just
four possible types and no dependencies between the features in the
product structure itself.

*Data collection*. We interviewed one researcher, with whom we have a
long running collaboration, at online and offline meetings, i.a., during
a visit at the I4.0 Testbed, in semi-structured interviews. Further, we
elicited relevant parts of the case study from documents that we
received from the researcher including
publications.

*Variability*. To be able to research the mentioned phenomena, the I4.0
Testbed is configured to assemble the *truck product line*, currently
consisting of four different 3D-printed truck variants. Basically, a
truck consists of three basic parts, the *chassis*, the *cabin*, and the
*body*. While the chassis and the cabin are the same in all truck
variants, there are four types of truck bodies: *dumper*, *opentop*,
*stakebed*, and *tank*. In addition, the single parts of the truck can
be produced in different colors. We do not consider the colors
as specific features to make the truck product line comparable to the
other case studies in this paper, where we also just consider parts
rather then their particular attributes.

*Configuration/Assembly*. When assembling the truck, the sequence of
production steps and the production resources depend on the particular
truck configuration. For instance, when assembling the dumper
configuration, the cabin needs to be mounted to the chassis before the
body. Similarly, the tank variant requires a production resource that is
narrow enough so it can grip between two particular points.

*Summary*. The complexity of the 3D-printed truck product line with just four product variants, two abstract assembly groups that categorize sub tree, and 30
dependencies (e.g., exclusion criteria between the body parts) between
the products is quite low. However, the case is a simple and
straightforward example to learn about/teach the concepts of variability
modeling.
