Case Study Water Filter – NanoFilter
------------------------------------

*Overview*. The *water filter* product line, the so-called *NanoFilter*, originates from a [development project
in Tanzania](https://gongalimodel.com/). In the project researchers investigated different
filter materials and constructions. The water
filter can filter impurities and, in contrary to most local solutions,
selectively remove contaminants from unsafe water sources. Depending on
its configuration, the *NanoFilter* costs about 5% to 25% less than
imported water filters. This way, the water filter addresses the basic
need of price-sensitive customers in developing countries by providing a
low-cost but customizable solution that works without electricity and
can be manufactured locally due to its simple structure and few
components.

*Data Collection*. A collaborating researcher (not an author of this
paper) collected the primary data for the case study by conducting a
semi-structured online interview and email communication with the
*Nanofilter*’s inventor. This data has been supported by secondary data
from the manual of the filter, project documents submitted for
[funding](www.globalgiving.com), and the company’s website. We iteratively elicited and
reviewed the case study from the gathered data and the resulting
knowledge from both data sources.

*Variability*. The *water filter* product line consists of eight
variants that contain up to 14 parts. To meet particular requirements,
e.g., use at home vs. in schools, or the water contamination rate, the
water filter variants differ in size, clean water production rate, and
the water purification technology. The water filter consists of a
standard or large *freshwater tank* for the cleaned water and a *filter
tank* of similar dimensions to purify the water. The *filter tank*
always contains *sand* and either *bone charcoal* or *active charcoal*
to filter particles and micro-organisms from the polluted water. For
severe water contamination, like certain chemicals, the water filter can
have an additional *nano filter*. For large variants of the water
filter, there is an additional *wastewater tank* to hold the polluted
water. Depending on the size of the water filter and whether the *nano
filter* is installed, the water filter is mounted on different sorts of
mounts like an *iron frame* or a large *rack*. Furthermore, some
auxiliary parts, such as *valves* and *tubes*, need to be installed.

*Configuration/Assembly*. The assembly sequence of the water filter is
relatively straightforward and implied by the configuration of the water
filter. However, to assemble the different configurations, different
resources might be needed, e.g., to lift the tanks and racks.

The [figure](https://twitter.com/GongaliModel/status/1217727935744004096/photo/1) shows a picture of two Nanofilter water
filters in different development stages with three tanks and a
nanofilter in the left water filter. The figure also shows a section of
the for the water filter product variants and the transformed feature
model. The water filter case consists
of eight product types and with 165 dependencies between the parts of
the product types (e.g., exclusion of bone and active charcoal).
Therefore, we consider the case’s complexity to be at a medium level.
